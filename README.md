# historical-data

This repository lists python codes of IEO tokens' historical data in some crypto exchanges and coinmarketcap. Each folder represents one exchange. You can find both scraping code and merging code. The scraping code refers to the official API document on exchange except coinmarketcap, which can help us to get token's cvs file of historical tradings separately. After we obtain the historical cvs. files for all tokens, we can apply the merging code to involve all the files into one cvs totally. Generally, data scraped from exchanges would set a sequence automatically and the first row is 0. So if we want to extract the trading infomations (price, volume, time etc) at the fisrt listing day, we merely need to filter all "0" of the sequece in the merging cvs file. So as the first week, month and quarter data.
